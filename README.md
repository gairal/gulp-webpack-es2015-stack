## Getting Started
### Dependencies
You need to install the following on you system
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you running Node version >= 8.0.0
* ruby (`brew install ruby`)

* `npm i` to install all dependencies
* `make start` or `npm start` to start the dev server

### Running the app
After all dependencies are installed, just run `make start` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch your files and build them.
webpack-dev-server will display the address and port of your server (by default, `http://0.0.0.0:3000`).

```bash
# build files then launch the server and watch files
make start
```
### Build files
